<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Peristaltic movement of the intestine propels food down the length of the gastrointestinal tract to promote nutrient absorption. Interactions between intestinal macrophages and the enteric nervous system regulate gastrointestinal motility, yet we have an incomplete understanding of the molecular mediators of this crosstalk. Here, we identify complement component 1q (C1q) as a macrophage product that regulates gut motility. Macrophages were the predominant source of C1q in the mouse intestine and most extraintestinal tissues. Although C1q mediates the complementmediated killing of bacteria in the bloodstream, we found that C1q was not essential for the immune defense of the intestine. Instead, C1q-expressing macrophages were located in the intestinal submucosal and myenteric plexuses where they were closely associated with enteric neurons and expressed surface markers characteristic of nerve-adjacent macrophages in other tissues. Mice with a macrophage-specific deletion of C1qa showed changes in enteric neuronal gene expression, increased neurogenic activity of peristalsis, and accelerated intestinal transit. Our findings identify C1q as a key regulator of gastrointestinal motility and provide enhanced insight into the crosstalk between macrophages and the enteric nervous system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Editor's evaluation</head><p>This study provides a fundamental finding that complement C1q produced by enteric macrophages shapes neuronal function and gut motility. The authors present convincing data showing that while macrophage-derived C1q is not necessary for defenses against enteric pathogens, it plays an important role in regulating neuronal gene expression and intestinal transit. These findings will be of interest to gastroenterologists, neuroscientists and immunologists in revealing a novel neuroimmune axis in gut homeostasis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Peristalsis is the physical force that propels food through the intestine, promoting digestion and nutrient absorption. The gastrointestinal motility that underlies peristalsis is a complex process that requires coordination of the activity of smooth muscle cells by enteric neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rao and Gershon, 2016)</ref>. Several studies have revealed that intestinal macrophages impact gastrointestinal motility by regulating the functions of enteric neurons and facilitating their interactions with smooth muscle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muller et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Matheis et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Macrophages carry out diverse functions in the intestine that vary according to their anatomical location. For example, macrophages that localize to the tissue located directly underneath the gut epithelium -known as the lamina propria -contribute to immune defense against pathogenic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gabanyi et al., 2016)</ref>. A distinct group of macrophages localizes to the tissues located beneath the lamina propria, between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers in the tissue region known as the muscularis externa. These muscularis macrophages express genes that are distinct from lamina propria macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gabanyi et al., 2016)</ref>. They directly regulate the activity of smooth muscle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Luo et al., 2018)</ref> and secrete soluble factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), which interact with the enteric neurons that control smooth muscle activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muller et al., 2014)</ref>. Muscularis macrophages thus play a key role in regulating gut motility. However, we have a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these macrophages regulate intestinal neuromuscular activity and gut motility.</p><p>C1q is a member of the defense collagen family that has distinct roles in immune defense and nervous system development and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bossi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Casals et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Shah et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Thielens et al., 2017)</ref>. It is composed of six molecules each of C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC, forming a 410 kDa oligomer. C1q circulates in the bloodstream, where it participates in immune defense against infection by recognizing antibodies bound to invading bacteria. This binding interaction initiates the classical complement pathway, which entails the recruitment and proteolytic processing of other complement components that rupture the bacterial membrane and recruit phagocytic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kishore and Reid, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Noris and Remuzzi, 2013)</ref>. C1q is also produced by microglia (brain-resident macrophage-like cells) in the brain where it promotes the pruning of neuronal synapses through an unclear mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hammond et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hong et al., 2016)</ref>. Consequently, C1q deficiency results in heightened synaptic connectivity in the central nervous system which can lead to epilepsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chu et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>C1q is also produced at barrier sites, such as the intestine, where encounters with commensal and pathogenic microbes are frequent. However, little is known about the physiological role of C1q in barrier tissues. Liver immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, produce serum C1q; however, the cellular source of C1q in barrier tissues including the intestine remains unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Petry et al., 2001)</ref>. Here, we show that C1q is produced by macrophages of the mouse intestine. Intestinal C1q-expressing macrophages exhibit properties of neuromodulatory macrophages from other tissues and are located close to enteric neurons that have a known role in controlling gut motility. Accordingly, mice lacking macrophage C1q exhibit altered expression of enteric neuronal genes, increased neurogenic peristaltic contractions, and accelerated gastrointestinal motility. These findings identify C1q as a key mediator of a neuroimmune interaction that regulates gut motility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>C1q is expressed by macrophages in the mouse small intestine Soluble defense collagens are an ancient, evolutionarily conserved family of antimicrobial proteins with shared structural features including a C-terminal globular head and a collagen-like region <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Casals et al., 2019)</ref>. Little is known about the function of defense collagens at mucosal barrier sites, where microbial encounter is frequent. Our initial goal in this study was to identify soluble defense collagens that are expressed by the mouse intestine and to assess their role in host defense. Therefore, we measured the expression of 18 defense collagen genes in the mouse small intestine and colon by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The most abundant soluble defense collagen transcripts in the small intestine and colon were those encoding C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1A</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1-figure</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>supplement 1).</head><p>Serum C1q is produced by liver dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(El-Shamy et al., 2018)</ref>. However, the cellular source(s) of C1q in peripheral tissues, including the intestine, is unknown. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted cell suspensions recovered from the small intestines of wild-type C57BL/6 mice revealed that C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc transcripts were most abundant in CD45 + cells, which include all immune cells, as compared to CD45 - cells, which encompass epithelial cells and other non-immune cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1B</ref>). Furthermore, C1q transcripts and protein were most abundant in CD45 + cells recovered from the subepithelial compartment, which includes both the lamina propria and muscularis, as compared to CD45 + cells recovered from the intraepithelial compartment of the small intestine (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>). Thus, C1q is expressed by immune cells located in the subepithelial compartment of the intestine and is largely absent from epithelial cells and intraepithelial immune cells.</p><p>To identify intestinal immune cells that express C1q, we further analyzed the subepithelial CD45 + cell population by flow cytometry. Expression of C1q transcripts and protein was highest in CD11b + M-HCII + F4/80 hi macrophages and was mostly absent from non-macrophage immune cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1E-H</ref>). Thus, C1q is expressed by macrophages in the mouse small intestine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Macrophages are the primary source of C1q in the mouse gastrointestinal tract</head><p>We next assessed whether macrophages are the primary source of C1q in the intestine by analyzing two mouse models. First, we depleted macrophages by injecting neutralizing antibodies directed against the receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1R)(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2A</ref>), which is required for the development of a subset of lamina propria macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bogunovic et al., 2009)</ref>   macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muller et al., 2014)</ref>. Antibody injection led to a &gt;twofold reduction in the number of macrophages recovered from the small intestine (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2B</ref>), and a corresponding reduction in small intestinal C1q gene expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2C</ref>), suggesting that macrophages are the primary source of intestinal C1q.</p><p>Second, we constructed a genetic model of C1q deficiency by crossing C1qa fl/fl mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fonseca et al., 2017)</ref> to mice carrying the Lyz2-Cre transgene (LysM-Cre mice), which is selectively expressed in myeloid cells including macrophages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2D</ref>). These mice, hereafter designated as C1qa ΔMϕ mice, lacked C1q expression in intestinal macrophages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2E</ref> and <ref type="figure">F</ref>). Importantly, C1qa ΔMϕ mice had markedly lower C1q expression in both the small intestine and colon (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">2G</ref>), indicating that macrophages are the main source of C1q in the intestine. Unexpectedly, the C1qa ΔMϕ mice also lost C1q gene expression in the lung, skin, kidney, and liver (but not the brain), and the C1q protein was undetectable in the serum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>-figure supplement 1). These findings indicate that macrophages are the primary source of C1q in the intestine and suggest that LysM + macrophages or macrophage-like cells are also the main sources of C1q in most extraintestinal tissues and the bloodstream. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C1qa ΔMφ mice do not show altered microbiota composition, barrier function, or resistance to enteric infection</head><p>The classical complement pathway is a well-studied host defense system that protects against systemic pathogenic infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Warren et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Noris and Remuzzi, 2013)</ref>. Circulating C1q activates the complement pathway by binding to antibody-antigen complexes or to bacterial cell surface molecules, and thus protects against systemic infection. Therefore, we assessed whether C1q promotes the immune defense of the intestine. We first determined whether C1q exhibits characteristics of known intestinal antimicrobial proteins, including induction by the intestinal microbiota and secretion into the gut lumen. C1qa was expressed at similar levels in the small intestines of germ-free and conventionally-raised mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3A</ref>), suggesting that C1q expression is not induced by the gut microbiota. This contrasted with Reg3g, encoding the antimicrobial protein REG3G <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cash et al., 2006)</ref>, which was expressed at a &gt; twofold higher level in conventional as compared to germ-free mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3A</ref>). Additionally, in contrast to REG3G, C1q was not detected in the gut lumen of either conventional or germ-free mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3B</ref>). C1qa expression was also not markedly altered by a 24 hr oral infection with the intestinal pathogenic bacterial species Salmonella Typhimurium (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3C</ref>). Although we cannot rule out the induction of C1q by longer-term pathogenic infections, these data indicate that C1q is not induced by the gut microbiota or by a 24 hr infection with S. typhimurium, in contrast to other intestinal antibacterial proteins.</p><p>We next assessed whether C1q regulates the composition of the gut microbiota. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of the fecal microbiotas of C1qa fl/fl and C1qa ΔMϕ mice showed that the microbiota composition was not appreciably altered in the absence of macrophage C1q (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3D</ref>). Analysis of 16 S rRNA gene copy number in mesenteric lymph nodes further indicated no statistically significant differences in translocation of the microbiota to the mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3E</ref>). We next challenged C1qa fl/fl and C1qa ΔMϕ mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), which damages the colonic epithelium and exposes underlying tissues to the commensal microbiota. However, the sensitivity of the C1qa ΔMϕ mice to DSS was similar to that of their C1qa fl/fl littermates as assessed by change in body weight and histopathological analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3F</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3-figure</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>supplement 1).</head><p>There was also no change in intestinal paracellular permeability in C1qa ΔMϕ mice as measured by oral administration of FITC-dextran (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3G</ref>). These results suggest that macrophage C1q does not substantially impact gut microbiota composition or intestinal epithelial barrier function.</p><p>To determine whether C1q protects against enteric infection we conducted oral infection experiments with the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. We chose C. rodentium as our model organism for two reasons. First, C. rodentium is a non-disseminating pathogen, allowing us to test specifically for C1q's role in intestinal infection. Second, C. rodentium clearance depends on immunoglobulins and complement component C3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Belzer et al., 2011)</ref>. Because C1q is bactericidal in concert with C3 and immunoglobulins, we predicted that C1qa ΔMϕ mice would be more susceptible to C. rodentium infection. However, C1qa ΔMϕ mice cleared C. rodentium similarly to their C1qa fl/fl littermates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3H</ref>) and showed similar histopathology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>-figure supplement 2), indicating that C1q is dispensable for defense against C. rodentium infection.</p><p>We also did not observe altered immunity in the absence of C1q. Measurement of transcripts encoding secreted immune effectors in the small intestines of C1qa fl/fl and C1qa ΔMϕ littermates revealed no statistically significant differences in cytokine expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3I</ref>). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in the percentages or absolute numbers of various T cell subsets, including T helper 1 (T H 1), T H 2, T H 17, and regulatory T (T reg ) cells between C1qa fl/fl and C1qa ΔMϕ mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3J</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>-figure supplement 3). Although total B cell numbers trended lower in C1qa ΔMϕ mice, the difference was not statistically significant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3J</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3-figure</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>supplement 4).</head><p>There were also no statistically significant differences in the percentages or absolute numbers of total plasma cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3J</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>-figure supplement 4), IgA + plasma cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3J</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>figure supplement 4), myeloid cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3J</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>-figure supplement 5), or innate lymphoid cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3J</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>-figure supplement 6) when comparing C1qa fl/fl and C1qa ΔMϕ mice. These results suggest that the absence of macrophage C1q has little impact on intestinal immunity. Altogether, our findings suggest that C1q does not participate substantially in intestinal immune defense and thus might have an intestinal function that is independent of its canonical role in activating the classical complement pathway. Representative immunoblot of an ammonium sulfate precipitation of intestinal luminal contents and feces from germ-free and conventional mice with detection of C1q.

Of the 22 biological pathways that were enriched in the LMMP of C1qa ΔMϕ mice, 17 were related to neuronal development or function, including synapse organization, dendrite development, and neurotransmitter secretion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6A</ref>). Our analysis also identified 30 differentially expressed genes with known roles in regulating neuronal activity (e.g. Dusp26), synaptic transmission (e.g. Rasgrf2), and neuropeptide signaling (e.g. Tacr2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mao et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Schwechter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Yang et al., 2017</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6B</ref>). We also compared the genes differentially expressed in the C1qa ΔMϕ mice to those differentially expressed in the TashT mouse line, which contains an insertional mutation that leads to dysregulated gut motility. The gut motility phenotypes in the TashT line are comparable to Hirschsprung's disease, a human genetic disorder resulting in incomplete development of the enteric nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bergeron et al., 2015)</ref>. A comparative analysis revealed a statistically significant overlap in the transcriptional changes in the colonic LMMP of C1qa ΔMϕ mice and the neural crest cells of TashT mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6B</ref>). These results suggested that macrophage C1q impacts enteric nervous system gene expression and function.</p><p>Efficient coordination of gastrointestinal motility is necessary for proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and excretion. Given that muscularis macrophages regulate enteric nervous system functions that govern gastrointestinal motility <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muller et al., 2014)</ref>, we assessed whether macrophage C1q impacts gut motility. We first tested this idea by measuring gut transit time using the nonabsorbable dye Carmine Red. C1qa ΔMϕ and C1qa fl/fl littermates were gavaged with the dye and the time to the first appearance of the dye in the feces was recorded. Transit times were decreased in C1qa ΔMϕ mice relative to their C1qa fl/fl littermates, indicating accelerated gut motility (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6C</ref>). This was not due to a change in the length of either the small intestine or the colon, which were unaltered in the C1qa ΔMϕ mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6D</ref>). By contrast, gut transit time was unchanged in C3 -/-mice, suggesting that macrophage C1q impacts gut motility independent of its canonical function in the classical complement pathway (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6C</ref>). Accelerated transit was also observed in the small intestines of C1qa ΔMϕ mice as assessed by rhodamine dye transit assay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6E</ref>). To assess colonic motility, we measured the expulsion time after intrarectal insertion of a glass bead and found that C1qa ΔMϕ mice had accelerated colonic motility when compared to C1qa fl/fl littermates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6F</ref>). Our results thus suggest that the absence of macrophage C1q results in defective enteric nervous system function and dysregulated gastrointestinal motility.</p><p>A limitation of in vivo measures of gut motility is that they cannot distinguish between defects in 'intrinsic' enteric neurons and 'extrinsic' neurons that innervate the gastrointestinal tract <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berthoud et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Uesaka et al., 2016)</ref>. We, therefore, used an ex vivo organ bath system to specifically assess enteric nervous system function by measuring the activity of colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMC; rhythmic peristaltic contractions that depend on the enteric nervous system) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Obata et al., 2020)</ref>. Spatiotemporal mapping revealed that the colons of C1qa ΔMϕ mice had increased total number, frequency, and velocity of CMMC as compared to C1qa fl/fl littermates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6G</ref> and H; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>-video 1; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6video 2</ref>). This indicated that the colons of C1qa ΔMϕ mice maintained increased neurogenic peristaltic activity compared to their C1qa fl/fl littermates even in the absence of gut-extrinsic signals. Thus, the absence of macrophage C1q increases enteric nervous system-dependent peristalsis and accelerates gut transit. Taken together, our findings reveal that macrophage C1q regulates gastrointestinal motility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Here, we have identified a role for C1q in regulating gastrointestinal motility. We discovered that macrophages are the primary source of C1q in the mouse intestine and that macrophage C1q regulates enteric neuronal gene expression and gastrointestinal transit time. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated function for C1q in the intestine and help to illuminate the molecular basis for macrophage-mediated control of gut motility.</p><p>Our study identifies macrophages as the main source of C1q in the mouse small intestine and colon. Both transient antibody-mediated depletion of macrophages and in vivo deletion of the C1qa gene from macrophages led to a marked reduction in intestinal C1q expression. The C1qa ΔMϕ mice also lacked C1q in the circulation, indicating that LysM + macrophages or macrophage-like cells are the sources of circulating C1q in the absence of infection. This enhances findings from prior studies indicating that monocytes, macrophages, and immature dendritic cells are the main sources of C1q in the bloodstream <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(El-Shamy et al., 2018)</ref>.

C1q was originally discovered as having a role in the classical complement pathway, which tags and destroys invading microbes <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Noris and Remuzzi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schifferli et al., 1986)</ref>. Circulating C1q binds to invading microorganisms and recruits additional proteins that assemble into the membrane attack complex (MAC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kishore and Reid, 2000)</ref>. C1q-mediated MAC formation has been described primarily in the bloodstream, where the necessary accessory proteins are present at high levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Davis et al., 1979)</ref>. However, even in the absence of infection, C1q is expressed in tissues such as the brain, where it regulates neuronal development and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kouser et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van Schaarenburg et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings suggest that C1q does not play a central role in the immune defense of the intestine. First, we found that intestinal C1q expression was not induced by gut commensals or pathogens and was not deposited into the gut lumen. Second, C1q deficiency did not markedly alter gut microbiota composition or the course of disease after DSS treatment. There were also no major changes in cytokine expression or numbers and frequencies of intestinal immune cells that would indicate dysregulated interactions with the microbiota. Third, C1q was not required for clearance of C. rodentium, a non-disseminating enteric pathogen whose clearance requires antigen-specific IgG and complement component 3 (C3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Belzer et al., 2011)</ref>. Although we cannot rule out a role for C1q in immune defense against other intestinal pathogens, or during chronic inflammation or infection, these findings suggest that C1q is not essential for intestinal immune defense in mice.</p><p>Instead, our results indicate that C1q influences enteric nervous system function and regulates intestinal motility. First, C1q-expressing macrophages were present in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses and resided close to enteric neurons. Second C1q-expressing macrophages expressed cell surface markers like those expressed by nerve-adjacent C1q-expressing macrophages in the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Ural et al., 2020)</ref>. Third, macrophage-specific deletion of C1qa altered enteric neuronal gene expression. Finally, consistent with the altered neuronal gene expression, macrophage-specific C1qa deletion altered gastrointestinal motility in both the small and large intestines. Thus, our results suggest that the function of C1q in the intestine is similar to its function in the brain, where it regulates the development and function of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Benoit and Tenner, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kouser et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van Schaarenburg et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A function for macrophage C1q in intestinal motility adds to the growing understanding of how gut macrophages regulate intestinal peristalsis. Prior work has shown that CSF1R + macrophages selectively localize to the muscularis of the mouse intestine <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muller et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gabanyi et al., 2016)</ref>. These macrophages secrete BMP2, which activates enteric neurons that regulate colonic muscle contraction and thus colonic motility <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muller et al., 2014)</ref>. We found that depletion of CSF1R + macrophages reduces intestinal C1q expression and that macrophage-specific deletion of C1qa alters enteric neuronal gene expression and activity. Thus, our findings suggest that C1q is a key component of the macrophage-enteric nervous system axis.</p><p>An important remaining question concerns the molecular mechanism by which C1q regulates gut motility. One possibility is that C1q shapes microbiota composition which, in turn, impacts gut motility. This idea is suggested by studies in zebrafish showing that a deficiency in intestinal macrophages leads to altered gut microbiota composition relative to wild-type zebrafish <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Earley et al., 2018)</ref>   studies in zebrafish and mice have shown that severe defects in enteric nervous system development produce changes in gut microbiota composition that are linked to dysregulated gut motility <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Rolig et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al., 2018)</ref>. However, we did not observe prominent changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in C1qa ΔMϕ mice, arguing against a central role for the microbiota in C1q-mediated regulation of gut motility. A second possibility is that the absence of C1q leads to immunological defects that alter gut transit time. This idea is consistent with studies showing that T-cell cytokines can influence gastrointestinal motility <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akiho et al., 2011)</ref>. However, this seems unlikely given the lack of pronounced immunological abnormalities in the intestines of C1qa ΔMϕ mice.</p><note type="other">.</note><p>A third possibility is that C1q changes the cell-intrinsic properties of the macrophages that express it, thus altering their interactions with neurons to influence gut motility. We explored this possibility by conducting single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on macrophages isolated from small intestinal cell suspensions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>-figure supplement 1A). We identified 11 unique macrophage clusters and found that C1qa ΔMϕ mice had alterations in at least three highly represented clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>figure supplement 1B). Gene set enrichment analysis of the most significantly altered clusters did not reveal any pronounced functional differences (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>-figure supplement 1C). However, analysis of the differentially expressed genes across all macrophage clusters indicated lowered representation of transcripts that are linked to control of macrophage differentiation or functional states, such as Malat1, Neat1, and Etv3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cui et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gao et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Villar et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure 6-figure supplement 1D)</ref>. Furthermore, a recent study identified a set of 13 'microglia-specific genes' that represent a unique transcriptional overlap between microglia in the CNS and intestinal macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Verheijden et al., 2015)</ref>. In macrophages from C1qa fl/fl mice, we observed the expression of eight 'microglia-specific genes' whose expression was lowered or lost in macrophages from C1qa ΔMϕ mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>-figure supplement 1E). Thus, it is possible that altered intestinal motility could arise in part from cell-intrinsic functional alterations in C1q-deficient intestinal macrophages. Such alterations could arise from a C1q autocrine signaling loop or C1q could imprint a neuronal function that feeds back to regulate macrophage gene expression as exemplified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Muller et al., 2014.</ref> A fourth possibility is that C1q + macrophages engulf specific neurons. Indeed, macrophages restrain neurogenesis in the enteric nervous system through phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons, which is consistent with the ability of C1q to opsonize dying host cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kulkarni et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botto et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Korb and Ahearn, 1997)</ref>. However, we observed no marked differences in the overall numbers of enteric neurons or numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons when comparing C1qa ΔMϕ and C1qa fl/fl mice, which argues against this possibility. A fifth possibility is that C1q acts directly on enteric smooth muscle cells that regulate gut motility. Although we cannot rule out this possibility, our transcriptional profile of the colonic myenteric plexus of C1qa ΔMϕ mice suggests that most of the transcriptional changes were associated with neuronal function and homeostasis.</p><p>Given that the C1qa ΔMϕ mice showed altered neuronal gene expression, a sixth possibility is that C1q interacts directly with enteric neurons or glial cells as a signaling molecule. Like macrophageproduced BMP2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muller et al., 2014)</ref>, C1q might bind to specific receptors on neurons to regulate their activity. In support of this idea, we observed that mouse enteric neurons express Adgrb1, which encodes BAI1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>-figure supplement 2A and B), a recently identified C1q receptor on human neural stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benavente et al., 2020)</ref>. These data suggest a possible signaling axis for C1qmediated control of enteric nervous system function.</p><p>Our findings on intestinal C1q have implications for human intestinal disease. Indeed, singlecell RNAseq analysis shows that macrophages recovered from the human intestinal muscularis selectively express C1q when compared to lamina propria macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Domanska et al., 2022)</ref>. Dysregulated peristalsis is a characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vrees et al., 2002)</ref> and is present in a subset of inflammatory bowel disease patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bassotti et al., 2014)</ref>. Our finding that macrophage C1q regulates gut motility could suggest new strategies to prevent or treat these diseases. Additionally, most humans with C1q deficiency develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Since C1q can target cellular debris for phagocytosis, it is thought that C1q deficiency results in increased exposure of self-antigen to the immune system, thereby reducing immune tolerance and causing autoimmune disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Macedo and Isaac, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, roughly 42.5% of SLE patients report gastrointestinal symptoms that range from acute abdominal pain to chronic intestinal obstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fawzy et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Tian and Zhang, 2010)</ref>. The exact cause of these symptoms is unclear. Given that C1q deficiency is strongly correlated with SLE in humans and alters gut motility in mice, we suggest that C1q could be a therapeutic target for SLE patients that present with chronic constipation or other forms of dysregulated intestinal motility.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation and analysis of intestinal immune cells</head><p>Lamina propria cells were isolated from the intestine using a published protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Yu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Yu et al., 2014)</ref>. Briefly, intestines were dissected from mice and Peyer's patches were removed. Intestines were cut into small pieces and thoroughly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (PBS-FBS). Epithelial cells were removed by incubating intestinal tissues in Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 2 mM EDTA, followed by extensive washing with PBS-FBS. Residual tissues were digested twice with Collagenase IV (Sigma), DNase I (Sigma), and Dispase (BD Biosciences) for 45 min at 37 °C with agitation. Cells were filtered through 70 μm cell strainers (Thermo Fisher) and applied onto a 40%:80% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare). Subepithelial cell populations were recovered at the interface of the 40% and 80% fractions. For small intestinal cell suspensions, the epithelial fraction was kept and combined with enzymatically liberated subepithelial cells. Cells were washed with 2 mM EDTA/3% FBS in PBS and Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (93). Cells were then stained with the viability dye Ghost 710 (Tonbo Biosciences) followed by antibodies against cell surface markers including anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-MHCII (M5/114.15.2), anti-F4/80 (BM8), anti-CD3 (17A2), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD19 (1D3), anti-B220 (RA3-6B2), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-CD169 (3D6.112), anti-TREM2 (237920), and anti-LY6C (RB6-8C5). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with the eBioscience FOXP3/Transcription Factor Fixation/Permeabilization buffer set (Thermo Fisher) and then subjected to intracellular staining with anti-C1Q (RmC7H8), anti-FOXP3 (FJK-16s), anti-GATA3 (L50), anti-T-BET (4B10), anti-RORγ (AFKJS-9), and anti-ARG1 (P05089).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein extraction from intestinal cells and feces</head><p>To isolate proteins from intestinal cell suspensions, cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Millipore Sigma) and vortexed vigorously every 5 min for 20 min. Lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 5 min. To isolate proteins from the intestinal lumen, the entire gastrointestinal tract (from the duodenum to distal colon) was recovered from five wild-types C57BL/6 J mice. The intestines were flushed with ~50 ml cold PBS containing protease inhibitors <ref type="bibr">(Millipore Sigma, 11836153001)</ref>. The flushes and fecal pellets were homogenized by rotor and stator (TH Tissue Homogenizer; OMNI; TH01) and large particles were centrifuged at 100 g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatants were carefully decanted and centrifuged further at 3000 g for 20 min at room temperature. The clarified supernatants were precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated protein was centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 min at 4 °C, then resuspended in cold 40% ammonium sulfate and centrifuged again. The pellets were resuspended in room temperature PBS and allowed to mix for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (BioRad).</p><p>Immunoblot 50 μg of fecal protein or 25 μg of cellular protein was loaded onto a 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane.

Slides were then washed in PBS-T and mounted with DAPI-Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Mounted slides were cured overnight at 4 °C until imaging.</p><p>For immunofluorescence analysis of longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus wholemounts, intestines were prepared by first removing the adipose tissues and flushing the luminal contents. A 1 ml pipette tip was inserted into the intestinal lumen to fully extend the intestinal wall. The longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus layer was then separated from the mucosa using cotton swabs as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahrends et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Obata et al., 2020)</ref>. The longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus layer was then stretched by pinning the tissues on a Sylgard-coated Petri dish (Fisher Scientific) containing cold PBS and fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. The fixed tissues were rinsed five times with PBS at room temperature with shaking and then permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) for 1 hr at room temperature. The tissues were incubated with primary antibodies in the same solution overnight at 4 °C. The tissues were then washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated with secondary antibodies in the blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature. Immunostained tissues were washed four times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100.

Total small intestinal cells were pooled according to genotype and live CD45 + CD11b + MHCI-I + F4/80 hi macrophages were sorted using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). 5000-10,000 macrophages from each genotype with a viability score of &gt;70% were input into each library. A 10 X Genomics Chromium controller instrument was used for Gel Bead-in Emulsion (GEMs) preparation. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' Kit v3.1 (PC-1000269), Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (PC-1000127), and Dual Index Kit TT Set A Kit (PC-1000215) were used for single-cell library preparation. cDNA and final barcoded sequencing libraries were generated according to the manufacturer's specifications and their quality and concentration were assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) and qPCR, respectively. Single-cell libraries that passed the quality checks were sequenced on a NextSeq550 sequencer using a paired-end 75 bp High Output sequencing kit. About 20,000-30,000 sequencing reads were generated per single cell. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts for each cellular barcode were quantified and used to estimate the number of cells successfully captured and sequenced. The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software suite (10 X Genomics) was used for demultiplexing, barcode processing, alignment, and initial clustering of the raw scRNAseq profiles.</p><p>The Seurat V3 R package was used to filter and analyze the Cell Ranger output <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Stuart et al., 2019)</ref>. Features that were in less than three cells and cells with less than 50 features were first filtered. To filter out dead or dying single cells, only cells that expressed more than 200 but less than 2500 features and cells in which mitochondrial transcripts accounted for less than five percent of all cell transcripts were used for further analysis. The single-cell data of these high-quality cells was then lognormalized and scaled. For further correction, the percentage of transcripts from mitochondria was regressed out. Dimension reduction was performed in Seurat and further differential gene expression was performed using limma <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ritchie et al., 2015)</ref>. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) via clusterProfiler <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yu et al., 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis</head><p>The hypervariable regions V3 and V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared using the Illumina Nextera protocol (Part # 15044223 Rev. B). An amplicon of 460 bp was amplified using the 16S Forward Primer and 16S Reverse Primer as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Primer sequences are given in the Key Resources Table . The PCR product was purified using Agencourt AmpureXP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics). Illumina adapter and barcode sequences were ligated to the amplicon to attach them to the MiSeqDx flow cell and for multiplexing. Quality and quantity of each sequencing library were assessed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and Picogreen (Thermo Fisher) measurements, respectively. Libraries were loaded onto a MiSeqDX flow cell and sequenced using the Paired End 300 (PE300) v3 kit. Raw fastq files were demultiplexed based on unique barcodes and assessed for quality. Samples with more than 50,000 quality control pass sequencing reads were used for downstream analysis. Taxonomic classification and operational taxonomic unit analysis were done using the CLC Microbial Genomics Module. Individual sample reads were annotated with the Greengene database and taxonomic features were assessed.</p></div>

To determine transit time through the entire gastrointestinal tract, age-matched male mice were fasted overnight and water was removed 1 hr prior to the start of the experiment. Mice were then singly housed for 1 hr and then gavaged with 100 μl of Carmine Red (5% weight/volume; Sigma) in 1.5% methylcellulose. Fecal pellets were collected every 15 min and transit time was recorded when the dye was first observed in the feces.</p><p>For small intestinal motility measurements, age-matched male mice were fasted overnight and then gavaged with 100 μl of rhodamine B-dextran (5 mg/ml; Thermo Fisher) in 2% methylcellulose. After 90 min, mice were sacrificed and their stomachs, small intestines, ceca, and colons were collected. Small intestines were cut into eight segments of equal length and colons were cut into five segments of equal length. Segments were cut open lengthwise and vortexed in 1 ml PBS to release rhodamine B-dextran. Fluorescence was then measured on a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The geometric center of the dye was calculated as: GC = Σ (% of total fluorescent signal per segment × segment number). Relative fluorescence per segment was calculated as: (fluorescence signal in segment/total fluorescence recovered) × 100.</p><p>To measure colonic motility, age-matched male mice were fasted overnight and lightly anesthetized with isoflurane. A 2 mm glass bead was inserted 2 cm intrarectally using a 2 mm surgical probe. Mice were then returned to empty cages and the time to reappearance of the bead was recorded.</p><p>To account for potential circadian differences in gut motility, the time of day for the initiation of all experiments was held constant.</p></div>

Colons were dissected, flushed with sterile PBS, and pinned into an organ bath chamber (Tokai Hit, Japan) filled with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). DMEM was oxygenated (95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ), run through the chamber using a peristaltic pump (MINIPULS 3, Gilson), and kept at 37 °C. Colons were allowed to equilibrate to the organ chamber for 20 min before video recording. Time-lapse images of colonic peristalsis were captured with a camera (MOMENT, Teledyne photometrics) using PVCAM software (500 ms time-lapse delay) and recorded for 45 min.</p><p>For analysis of colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMC), videos consisting of 5400 sequential image frames were stitched together in Fiji and read into Igor Pro 9 (WaveMetrics) to generate spatiotemporal maps using a customized algorithm developed by the Pieter Vanden Berghe lab at the University of Leuven, Belgium <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Roosen et al., 2012)</ref>. The generated spatiotemporal maps were used to determine the frequency and period of CMMCs. Each CMMC on the spatiotemporal map was further projected onto the axes to obtain the distance traveled (millimeters) and the time for the CMMC to travel such distance (seconds), allowing us to calculate the velocity (millimeter/second) of CMMCs.</p></div>
